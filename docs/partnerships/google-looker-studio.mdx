# Google Looker Studio Integration

Google Looker Studio is a free online tool for converting data into visual dashboards and reports. The IQM Reports custom connector provides a way to import your IQM ad-serving reporting data into Google Looker Studio, where it can be used to create visualizations.

## Prerequisites

Before using the IQM Reports connector, you must have:
- An active IQM account with API access
- A Google account

## Setup

### Step 1: Select the IQM Reports Connector

1. Navigate to the [IQM Reports connector page](https://datastudio.google.com/data?search=iqm)
2. Click the **Authorize** button and select your Google account in the "Choose an Account" popup

### Step 4: Configure Parameters

1. Under **Parameters**, select the time zone that should be used for dates when viewing the reporting data

2. Click **Create Report** to continue
3. You'll be directed to either:
   - A blank report connected to your IQM data (if template option was unchecked)
   - A report using the default report template (if template option was checked)

For more information about building visual reports in Google Looker Studio, refer to the [official Google Looker Studio documentation](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/topic/6369007?hl=en&ref_topic=6291037).

## Using the Default Report Template

The report template provides an editable default dashboard to display your IQM ad-serving data.

### Navigating the Report

To view different pages of the default report, click the arrows below the report title at the top of the page.

### Changing the Date Range

1. Click the date dropdown and select a new date range
2. This modifies the data loaded into all charts and visuals in the report

### Editing the Report

1. Click the **Edit** button at the top-right of the page
2. To edit a specific chart or visualization, click on it to open the related properties panel
3. In the properties panel, you can modify:
   - The dimension that data is grouped by (Campaigns, Creatives, congressional districts, etc.)
   - The metrics displayed in the chart (impressions, clicks, win rate, etc.)

### Adding New Pages

Select **Page > New Page** from the toolbar at the top.

## Sharing the Report

You can share the reports you create with Looker Studio with other people.

### Best Practices for Sharing

Before sharing your report:
- Include only information relevant to the recipient
- If you run Campaigns for multiple clients, include only Campaigns for the specific client you're sharing with
- Consider creating a new data source for each report you plan to share

### Data Credentials Options

If you don't want people you share a report with to be asked to input IQM platform credentials, use **Owner's credentials** as the report Data Credentials as described in [Google Looker Studio help](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6371135).

### Public Sharing

If you don't want recipients to be asked for Google Account credentials, share the report as a **Public Link** as described in [Google Looker Studio help](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/7020039).
