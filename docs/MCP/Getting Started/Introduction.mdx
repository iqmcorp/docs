# Introduction

## What is an MCP Server?

MCP, or Model Context Protocol, is an open standard developed by Anthropic that simplifies how AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs), interact with external data, tools, and services. 

It acts as a universal interface, allowing AI models to access information and functionality from various sources, similar to how an API works, but with a focus on enabling agentic AI to perform tasks autonomously.

There are two main components of MCP:
1. MCP Server 
1. MCP Client


### MCP Server

An MCP server, within the context of the Model Context Protocol, is a program that provides access to data, tools, or prompts to AI models, enabling them to interact with the external world. It acts as a bridge, connecting AI agents (like large language models) to external resources and services. Essentially, it allows AI to go beyond its training data and incorporate new information and functionalities. 


### MCP Client

On the other side, an MCP client lives inside the AI assistant or app (like Claude or Cursor). When the AI wants to use a tool, it goes through this client to talk to the matching server.


## What Can IQM MCP Do?

IQM MCP is a natural language interface that connects your integrated IQM’s data with the LLM platform, enabling you to extract valuable insights by using prompts like:

* “Give me the list of my running campaigns.”

* “What is the segment ID for age 25-34?”

* “Change the daily budget of campaign ID 123 to $30.”

All in real-time, directly inside your LLM chat interface.
