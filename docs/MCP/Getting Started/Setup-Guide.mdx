# Setup Guide

## Overview 

IQM MCP is a powerful interface that allows AI models to access information and functionality of IQM's various apps. Use this set up guide to get up and running with IQM MCP. 

## Before You Begin

Before you can use the IQM MCP, you will need access to use IQM's API service. See the [Getting Started](/Getting%20Started/Before-You-Begin) guide and [Authentication Quickstart Guide](/Quickstart%20Guides/Authentication-Quickstart-Guide) for more information. 

## Setup Guide

To use IQM MCP you will need the following tools:

* UV 
* mcp-proxy 
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
* [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)

### Tools Installation

Follow these steps and run the following commands to install the necessary tools to configure the MCP servers:

##### 1. Install UV

```bash 
brew install uv
```

##### 2. Install MCP Proxy:

```bash 
uv tool install mcp-proxy
```

##### 3. Locate mcp-proxy Path

Once these tools are installed, locate the exact path of mcp-proxy:

```bash
which mcp-proxy
```

##### 4. Configure MCP Server


Then you can open **Claude Desktop → Settings → Developer → Edit Config**

This will open a JSON config file, to which you can add the MCP servers:

```json title="claude_desktop_config.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iqm-mcp-1": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/Users/<your-username>/.local/bin/mcp-proxy",
      // The above command value is your mcp-proxy path where <your-username> is your actual system name
      "args": [
        "--transport", "streamablehttp",
        "http://maas-dashboard.data.stage.iqm/<MCP_SERVER_1>/mcp"
      // <MCP_SERVER_1> is a placeholder for actual MCP servers
      ]
    },
   "iqm-mcp-2": {
    // Additional server blocks can be added like this
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/Users/<your-username>/.local/bin/mcp-proxy",
      "args": [
        "--transport", "streamablehttp",
        "http://maas-dashboard.data.stage.iqm/<MCP_SERVER_2>/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
 }
```

##### 5. Restart Claude Desktop

Once the JSON config file is saved, you can quit and restart Claude desktop. On startup you should see a message confirming your connection the IQM's MCP servers. You can also check the **Claude Desktop → Settings → Developer** screen:

### GitHub Copilot Setup

IQM MCP also supports [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) integration. To set this up, follow these steps:

##### 1. Configure MCP servers

Create a **.vscode** folder in your project and create an **mcp.json** file in that folder. Use this configuration as a template:

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
  "servers": {
    "iqm-mcp-1": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/Users/<your-username>/.local/bin/mcp-proxy",
      // The above command value is your mcp-proxy path where <your-username> is your actual system name
      "args": [
        "--transport", "streamablehttp",
        "http://maas-dashboard.data.stage.iqm/<MCP_SERVER_1>/mcp"
      // <MCP_SERVER_1> is a placeholder for actual MCP servers
      ]
    },
   "iqm-mcp-2": {
    // Additional server blocks can be added like this
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/Users/<your-username>/.local/bin/mcp-proxy",
      "args": [
        "--transport", "streamablehttp",
        "http://maas-dashboard.data.stage.iqm/<MCP_SERVER_2>/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
 }
```

##### 2. Open GitHub Copilot

Now open GitHub Copilot and you will see the MCP servers you configured in the list of available servers. Ensure that you are in Agent mode, not Ask mode.

:::warning[NOTE]

You may need to de-select some tools for Github Copilot to be able to make a succesful request, as it only allows 128 tools at a time.

## Use IQM MCP!

You are now ready to use IQM MCP! 

Once you've restarted Claude Desktop (or GitHub Copilot) and ask to access IQM's API, you will be prompted for your for your authentication credentials. You will need to provide your Organization Worskpace ID, a bearer token, and Workspace URL. See [Sign Up and Authenticate](/Quickstart%20Guides/Authentication-Quickstart-Guide/) for more information.

Next, you can check out the [MCP Actions](/MCP/MCP%20Actions/) collection to see some example prompts and supported actions.
