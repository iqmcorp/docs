# Create an Insights Report

## About IQM Insights

Insights reports are one of IQM's analytics tools that help Advertisers quickly identify trends and apply precise adjustments to deliver better results for Campaigns. With pre-defined metrics and dimensions, Insights reports can be generated for the following areas:
   * **Campaign Bidding Insights** capture rejected Campaigns and segments them based on rejection reason, allowing you to assess which parameters are limiting a Campaign's success.
   * **Audience Insights** provide in-depth Reports of Audience characteristics, interests, and behaviors to give you a deeper understanding of your target Audience and create targeted and personalized advertising strategies.
   * **Voter Level Data** (VLD) Reports offer Insights about targeting in current or prior political Campaigns. These Reports include ad exposure, engagement data, demographic data, and voting-history details by voter.
   * **Provider Level Data** (PLD) Reports include details about healthcare professionals targeted in your Campaigns, and provide similar details as VLD Reports while adhering to healthcare data privacy regulations.

## Before You Begin

To generate an Insights Report you will need an Account On the IQM Platform (See [Before You Begin](/Getting%20Started/Before-You-Begin) to create an account and request a Client ID and Client). Once you have an account you can log in and review the eligibility requirements table for each kind of Insights Report.
