# REST API Overview

The IQM platform uses standard [REST API<ExternalLink />](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) calls and responses for its applications. Our API has URLs organized by resource, supports form-encoded requests, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes. 

```json title="Base URL"
https://app.iqm.com
```

Review the following sections for the basic information on API specifications to avoid errors and workflow interruptions. 

## Prerequisites 

The minimum requirements are: creating an account with IQM, running at least one Campaign, and attaining authentication to use the platform. Review the [Getting Started](/Getting%20Started/Before-You-Begin) page for details on these requirements before using the IQM API. 

Once these steps are completed see the other [Quickstart Guides](/Quickstart%20Guides/) and the [Guidelines](/Guidelines/) pages for a comprehensive overview of the IQM platform's API. 

## Authentication

The IQM API uses [bearer authentication<ExternalLink />](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/bearer-authentication/) tokens to authenticate as well as an **Organization Workspace ID** (<var>owId</var>). Authentication is obtained on sign up and log in. 

Refer to the [Sign Up and Authenticate](/docs/Quickstart%20Guides/Authentication-Quickstart-Guide.mdx) Quickstart Guide for more information.

## HTTP Request Methods

Data resources are accessed via standard HTTP requests in UTF-8 format to an API endpoint. Refer to [MDN Documentation<ExternalLink />](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTTP/Methods) on methods for more information. 

The IQM API uses the following HTTP methods:

## Response Codes and Samples 

IQM uses HTTP status codes. Please refer to [MDN Documentation<ExternalLink />](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTTP/Status)  on status codes for more information. 

API calls will return a JSON formatted response consisting of a <var>success</var> boolean and, often, a <var>message</var>, <var>data</var>, or <var>error</var> property describing the success or failure. Below is a table of common status codes and response samples. 

<div class="container">
  <div class="child1a">

| <var>422</var> | Unprocessable Entity |
| <var>429</var> | Too Many Requests |

<div class="child2b">

```json title="Response 200"
{
  "success": true,

}
```

```json title="Response 422"
{

    }
  ]
}
```

</div></div>
