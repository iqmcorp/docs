# MCP Reports Tutorial

Use the IQM MCP to interact with the Reports app.

## Overview

This tutorial will guide you through using IQM MCP to manage Reports on the IQM Platform. You will learn how to create, execute, and schedule Reports using MCP prompts.

## Before You Begin

To manage Reports using IQM MCP the following are required:

1. An Account On the IQM Platform
   *  See [Getting Started](/getting-started/before-you-begin) section to create an account and request a Client ID and Client Secret
1. The IQM MCP Set Up On Your Computer
   * See the MCP [Setup Guide](/mcp/mcp-getting-started/setup-guide/) to set up the MCP with your authorization credentials
1. At least one active Campaign on the IQM Platform
   * See the [Create a Campaign](/quickstart-guides/create-a-campaign-quickstart/) Quickstart Guide

## About IQM Reports

IQM Reports allow you to track various metrics of Campaign performance. You can create custom Reports to analyze data such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue across different dimensions like time, geography, device type, and more.

Reports can be either daily or aggregated. The daily Report will include the date as a dimension and provide the data breakdown by date. 

You can run a Report containing up to three months of data for any dimension combination or up to one year for the Campaign dimension. You must run multiple Reports if you need more than that amount of data.

## Create and Execute a Report

### Step 1: Request Metrics and Dimensions

Choose the dimensions and metrics desired for the Report. Reports will be in table format where the metrics comprise the columns, and the dimensions comprise the rows.

See the complete [Dimensions and Metrics Details](/guidelines/reports-api/#get-dimensions-and-metrics-details) API documentation and the [Report Dimensions and Metrics<ExternalLink />](https://help.iqm.com/en/collections/11287049-report-dimensions-and-metrics) Help Center article for more information on available dimensions and metrics. 

Try the following prompt to get a list of available dimensions and metrics:

<table className='mcpTable' style={{maxWidth: "fit-content"}}>
<th style={{ minWidth: "300px"}}>Prompt</th>
<th>Response Example</th>
<th>Notes</th>
<tr>
  <td>Show me a list of reporting metrics and dimensions</td>
  <td><ImageLightbox
      thumb={ReportsMetrics}
      full={ReportsMetrics}
      alt="MCP Reporting Metrics and Dimensions"
      size={200}         
      radius={8}     
    /></td>  
  <td>MCP retrieves list of available reporting metrics and dimensions with IDs and descriptions.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Step 2: Select a Timezone

Once metrics and dimensions are chosen, choose a timezone to target. Only one timezone can be included per Report. Run multiple Reports to see results for multiple timezones.

Try the following prompt to get a list of available timezones:

<table className='mcpTable' style={{maxWidth: "fit-content"}}>
<th style={{ minWidth: "300px"}}>Prompt</th>
<th>Response Example</th>
<th>Notes</th>
<tr>
  <td>Show me a list of of US timezone IDs</td>
  <td><ImageLightbox
      thumb={ReportsTimezone}
      full={ReportsTimezone}
      alt="MCP Reporting Timezones"
      size={200}         
      radius={8}     
    /></td>  
  <td>MCP retrieves list of available US timezone IDs with descriptions. You can specify by region, country, or specific timezone name</td>
  </tr>
