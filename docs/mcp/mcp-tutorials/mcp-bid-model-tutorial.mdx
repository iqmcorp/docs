## About IQM Bid Modeling 

The Bid Model API allows you to optimize advertising Campaigns for better performance. You can fine-tune metrics such as where ads appear (Include/Exclude), manage Campaign priority, and dimensions by which a Campaign is subdivided.

Bid Modeling comprises the following tools:

  * **Spend Ratio**: determines how the Campaign budget is distributed across various dimensions, expressed as a percentage in two types
    1.  Strict: budget is allocated up to its specified percentage as able, but will underspend if unable to meet that ratio
    1.  Flexible: budget will reallocate if unable to fulfill its specified percentage
  * **Dimension Priority**: dictates the sequence of bidding for specified targeting Dimensions, expressed as a range of 1-10
  * **Bid Modifier**: adjusts the base bid of a Campaign for the specified Dimension that is modified, expressed as a multiplier in a range of 0.1-100
